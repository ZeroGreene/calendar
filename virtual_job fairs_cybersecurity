What to Know & How to Get the Most Out of These Fairs

Register in advance — Many of these fairs require signup (sometimes early) and may even require a particular email domain (.edu for CAE VCF, membership for certain clubs).

Have your résumé ready & polished — Virtual fairs often allow you to upload résumé in advance or share immediately when chatting with recruiters.

Be prepared to video chat / attend live — These events rely on online video / text-chat booths. Make sure your audio/video works fine.

Be flexible about roles — Especially for broad virtual fairs (like FirstFridayFair or CyberConnect) — they may include roles beyond cyber, but you might find remote-friendly cyber/IT jobs or leads.

Check clearance-requirements — If you attend fairs like ClearanceJobs, many gigs require security clearance, so be ready to show eligibility.
